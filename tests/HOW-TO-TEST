Testing a Google App Engine app
===============================

This app uses the nose testing framework.  To get started, make sure
you've installed the necessary components:

sudo easy_install nose
sudo easy_install NoseGAE

Download WebTest (http://pythonpaste.org/webtest).
cd into webtest directory then:
sudo python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

If all the components have been downloaded and installed correctly,
you'll be able to run tests from the command line:

nosetests -v --with-gae --with-doctest

The above will run doctests embedded in source files as well as
test scripts in the /tests directory.
